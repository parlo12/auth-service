// This is a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello, Auth Service!" when accessed.
// It listens on port 8080 and can be extended to include authentication logic.
// The server is set up using the net/http package in Go.
// The main function initializes the server and handles incoming requests.
// The http.HandleFunc function is used to define the route and the corresponding handler function.
// The server is started using http.ListenAndServe, which takes the port and a nil handler.
// The server will run indefinitely until interrupted.
// The fmt package is used to print messages to the console.
// The server can be tested by accessing http://localhost:8080 in a web browser or using curl.
// This code is a basic starting point for an authentication service.
// It can be expanded with additional features such as user registration, login, and token management.
// The server can be integrated with a database to store user information.
// Middleware can be added for logging, error handling, and security.
// The server can also be containerized using Docker for easier deployment.
// This code is a simple example and should not be used in production without proper security measures.
// The server can be extended to handle different HTTP methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
// The server can also be configured to use HTTPS for secure communication.
// The code can be organized into separate packages for better maintainability.
// The server can be tested using unit tests and integration tests.
